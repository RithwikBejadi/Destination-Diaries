        <h4>The hype is real!</h4>
        <p>I always thought it might be just like many other Mughal palaces and forts in India only with white marble but when I first looked at it I was mesmerized by its beauty. It is definitely the epitome of architecture and beauty. A must visit place.</p>

        <h4>Wah Taaaajjjjjjj!!!!.</h4>
        <p>The Taj Mahal, a magnificent white marble mausoleum located in Agra, India, is a breathtaking masterpiece of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. This iconic monument is renowned worldwide for its timeless beauty and historical significance. The Taj Mahal's awe-inspiring symmetry and intricate details reflect the meticulous craftsmanship of the artisans. There are 11 tombs + 11 tombs at the main gate marking the 22 years it took to build Taj Mahal.</p>

        <h4>Tajrrefic</h4>
        <p>Had a great experience and the Taj Mahal is truly breathtaking. Would also recommend Alankar Gupta as a guide he was very knowledgeable. If I didn’t have a guide I’d just be looking at a beautiful building with my guide I experienced the wonder.</p>
