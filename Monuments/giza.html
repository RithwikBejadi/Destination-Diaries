        <h4>Amazing … if you are fit and healthy!</h4>
        <p>Once in a lifetime experience. However, think carefully before you decide to go inside Pyramid #1. It’s very claustrophobic and the “corridors” are very narrow. Much of the climb is at 45 degree angle. Plus it’s very hot!</p>

        <h4>Visiting is a must if travelling to Eqypt.</h4>
        <p>The feeling of history here is amazing. It's one thing to see this place on the internet and TV, but to be here stood in front of the pyramids is surreal. It's very hot as would be expected and the most important thing is to go with a licenced and reputable guide. They will ensure the many hustlers/scammers/beggars leave you alone and stop you from being extorted. Going inside the great pyramid is a must, although avoid if claustrophobic. It's literally like walking through a sauna fully clothed with some small walkways. Although there is nothing actually inside, to be able to walk through such an old piece of significant human history is amazing!</p>

        <h4>THE EIFFEL TOWER</h4>
        <p>The Eiffel Tower, what more can I say? It's absolutely amazing and beautiful. You should definitely go there at sunset and at night. Bringing a bottle of wine to enjoy while gazing at the sunset is a great way to experience some romance. You'll find many couples and families there, and sometimes people playing musical instruments or singing in the vicinity, creating a very romantic atmosphere. You can see the iconic symbol of Paris</p>

      <p id="min">If you plan your trip for January, February, October, or November, you'll have an easier time getting reservations to the best restaurants in Paris, like Le Dôme, and have a shorter wait in line for attractions like the Paris Catacombs — and you might have a better chance at seeing the views from the Eiffel Tower</p>
