        <h4>Visit to Pune is not complete if you haven't visited Dagadusheth
        </h4>
        <p>1.⁠ ⁠Your Pune visit is not completed if you have not visited Dagadusheth Ganpati. <br>
          2.⁠ ⁠No matter when you visit, there is always a queue however it doesn’t take more than 10min. <br>
          3.⁠ ⁠You will feel happy from inside as soon as you are in temple and it is hard to put it in words. <br>
          4.⁠ ⁠Parking for 2 wheeler is challenge here and 4wheeler is nightmare. <br>
          5.⁠ ⁠There is a small window by which you can have darshan without going into queue. <br>
          6.⁠ ⁠Temple is well managed and clean. <br>
          7.⁠ ⁠Timing is 5:00 AM to 10:30 PM (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).</p>

        <h4>Very peaceful temple in a crowded place.
        </h4>
        <p>As it wasn't weekend or any holiday I was able to do darshan in less den 5 minutes.
          Parking of vehicle can be a big problem so plan accordingly.
