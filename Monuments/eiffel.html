        <h4>Helicopter ride from Broome airport to Willie Creek and return along Cable Beach, Broome</h4>
        <p>We booked a trip to Willie Creek Pearl Farm by flying with KAS Helicopters. We were picked up at our accommodation and taken to the airport for a beautiful flight along Cable Beach to Willie Creek. The pilot was great, knowledgeable and provided smooth flying. The return trip was just as good if not better as we got to swing around the end of Cable Beach, past the port and Town beach before landing. The helicopter is open on the two front seats but the wind was no issue and safety well explained. Recommended</p>

        <h4>It is fine, but Paris has better places</h4>
        <p>It is beautiful and for sure a place you must see, the views are breathtaking. It is very beautiful to see it also at night. And I would recommend seeing it from different spots. But don't get overexcited, the area around it is overcrowded and a bit dirty, some corners and paths smelt bad. It also takes a lot of waiting in line.</p>
