        <h4>Helicopter ride from Broome airport to Willie Creek and return along Cable Beach, Broome</h4>
        <p>We booked a trip to Willie Creek Pearl Farm by flying with KAS Helicopters. We were picked up at our accommodation and taken to the airport for a beautiful flight along Cable Beach to Willie Creek. The pilot was great, knowledgeable and provided smooth flying. The return trip was just as good if not better as we got to swing around the end of Cable Beach, past the port and Town beach before landing. The helicopter is open on the two front seats but the wind was no issue and safety well explained. Recommended</p>

        <h4>It is fine, but Paris has better places</h4>
        <p>It is beautiful and for sure a place you must see, the views are breathtaking. It is very beautiful to see it also at night. And I would recommend seeing it from different spots. But don't get overexcited, the area around it is overcrowded and a bit dirty, some corners and paths smelt bad. It also takes a lot of waiting in line.</p>

        <h4>THE EIFFEL TOWER</h4>
        <p>The Eiffel Tower, what more can I say? It's absolutely amazing and beautiful. You should definitely go there at sunset and at night. Bringing a bottle of wine to enjoy while gazing at the sunset is a great way to experience some romance. You'll find many couples and families there, and sometimes people playing musical instruments or singing in the vicinity, creating a very romantic atmosphere. You can see the iconic symbol of Paris</p>

      <p id="head1">Best of the Months to visit:</p>
      <p id="min">If you plan your trip for January, February, October, or November, you'll have an easier time getting reservations to the best restaurants in Paris, like Le Dôme, and have a shorter wait in line for attractions like the Paris Catacombs — and you might have a better chance at seeing the views from the Eiffel Tower</p>
