        <h4>A great way to learn the history of Rome</h4>
        <p>We learned a lot about the history of Rome. This activity should be the starting point of the trip because it provides a great foundation for understanding the city's magnificent historical sites. In addition to the main presentation, we explored four other attractions in detail. Highly recommended!</p>

        <h4>Best city in the world ^-^</h4>
        <p>I have been to Rome during my eurotrip. I had heard nothing about this city before from anyone and I wasn't even asking anyone. I was just going to Rome because it has Colosseum but after getting there and starting the tour in city. I found the city not just really beautiful and historical but it has a different charm which makes it magnificent. Every street of Rome have something to say.

            You will find great architecture in every building of city and the great monuments are spread all around the city. For more there is vatican city with the greatest church of Europe. I just had 2 days in Rome but now I wish, I should have spent more time there.Thanks for Reading.Tell me what do you think in comments down below. Peace;</p>
