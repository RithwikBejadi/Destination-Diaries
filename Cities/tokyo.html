        <h4>Tokyo is like living in the future.</h4>
        <p>I enjoy exploring Tokyo for it's innovative technology, it's delicious high quality cuisine and the shopping. I loved visiting the electronics district (Akihabara), especially Yodobashi electronics store to see what are the latest gadgets, visiting the trendy district (Shibuya) for it's stylish clothes and anime. Toys are everywhere. Japanese anime is everywhere. My favorite stores to visit for that are Kiddy Land & Snoopy Town in Harajuku. So much to see, so little time to see everything. Try to stay at least one week in Tokyo before visiting other cities in Japan. You'll need at least that amount of time to see a good portion of Tokyo.</p>

        <h4>Visiting Japan</h4>
        <p>My husband and I recently took a trip to Tokyo, Japan. It was very different than what we had imagined. Being from the USA, everything seemed to be mini-sized, especially the food portions (but we didn't complain about it, it just gave us the chance to eat again in a few hours). There were vending machines almost everywhere you went, you could get a drink, snack, or even a beer! We struggled a little bit with trying to understand the subway system, but if you knew the station you were going to, then we just counted the stops, and that seemed to work out.</p>

        <h4>A land of contrasts</h4>
        <p>Tea ceremonies and 21st century technology firms can be found in the same street. As we moved between the areas we saw glass and chrome skyscrapers jostle with traditional buildings. There are frequently used shrines such as the gilded Senso-ji that celebrates Budhhism arriving in Japan. Women, children - and even traffic - are venerated at multiple shrines around the city. Look for the dolls with red neckerchiefs around the necks.</p>

      <p id="head1">Best of the Months to visit:</p>
      <p id="min">The best time to visit Japan is during spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November). This is when Japan is at its most vibrant, with delicate cherry blossom or bright red leaves adding contrast to the scenery. Remember, it can also be very crowded at this time.</p>
