        <h4>Amazing … if you are fit and healthy!</h4>
        <p>Once in a lifetime experience. However, think carefully before you decide to go inside Pyramid #1. It’s very claustrophobic and the “corridors” are very narrow. Much of the climb is at 45 degree angle. Plus it’s very hot!</p>

        <h4>Visiting is a must if travelling to Eqypt.</h4>
        <p>The feeling of history here is amazing. It's one thing to see this place on the internet and TV, but to be here stood in front of the pyramids is surreal. It's very hot as would be expected and the most important thing is to go with a licenced and reputable guide. They will ensure the many hustlers/scammers/beggars leave you alone and stop you from being extorted. Going inside the great pyramid is a must, although avoid if claustrophobic. It's literally like walking through a sauna fully clothed with some small walkways. Although there is nothing actually inside, to be able to walk through such an old piece of significant human history is amazing!</p>

      <p id="head1">Best of the Months to visit:</p>
      <p id="min">The best time to visit the Giza Pyramids is from October to February, when the weather is mild and comfortable, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 20°C (59°F to 68°F). This is also the peak tourist season, but it's worth it for the pleasant weather and longer days.</p>
