        <h4>New York city top attractions</h4>
        <p>If you're in New York city and want to see the tip sites, I would strongly suggest you purchase the New York City Pass. It lets you bypass the ticket lineups at the 6 most popular attractions/museums and saves you almost 50% off the regular purchase price. Last week we did New York in 3 days. We started with a Circle Line Cruise, then the Empire State Building observation deck, following by the MET museum. The next day we visited MOMA and the Gugenheim. Finally, the Natural History museum. Even if you only have time to visit 4 of the sites, you are still saving some money and time.</p>

        <h4>Moderate Experience!!</h4>
        <p>My experience in NYC has been met with hard times, good times & those times in between when everything just feels impossible. However, i do love the food, the diversity, and the culture. Its fast, expensive, and youll have a good time. The one thing i would change about NYC is the congestion and influx of people that live here. I would also change the fact that there needs to be more parking available for its own residents</p>

        <h4>Huge Criminal Exposure</h4>
        <p>My experience in New York City is insane. It definitely exposes you to a lot of things, such as gun violence , crack heads, drug dealers,robbery , and some much more. The safety in New York as a young girl isnâ€™t that great. This city is full of weird people. I recommend being aware of the area you live in the crime rate is extremely high.</p>
